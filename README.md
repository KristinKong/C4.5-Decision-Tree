1.Enviroment
	IDE：Pycharm 2018 2.3 x64
	Interpreter：Anaconda 3（syntax is python 3.6）

2.How to run?  (Note：I have already done the initial configuration which can run directly)

  (1) Modify the configuration file of config.cfg in the folder.
  (2) Each parameter is separated by a comma (,) and a comma is added at the end.
  (3) To generate the training set and test set, change the parameter in the main function of DecTree.py to "RAW".
  (4) The effective number of lines in the configuration file is from the first line to the sixth line. Only the first 6 lines of Iris are valid in the current file.
