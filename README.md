# Use C4.5 as well as PEP pruning algorithm to implement decision tree, and the language used is python.
## 1.Enviroment
	<br>IDE：Pycharm 2018 2.3 x64</br>
	<br>Interpreter：Anaconda 3（syntax is python 3.6）</br>
	<br></br>
## 2.How to run?  (Note：I have already done the initial configuration which can run directly)
	<br>(1) Modify the configuration file of config.cfg in the folder.</br>
	<br>(2) Each parameter is separated by a comma (,) and a comma is added at the end.</br>
	<br>(3) To generate the training set and test set, change the parameter in the main function of DecTree.py to "RAW".</br>
	<br>(4) The effective number of lines in the configuration file is from the first line to the sixth line. Only the first 6 lines of Iris are valid in the current file.</br>
